# Thanks

[Ray Wylie Hubbard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Wylie_Hubbard)
closes his song [Mother
Blues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIQVG0Bcu6w) with the words
> "And the days that I keep my gratitude higher than my expectations, I
have really good days."

For me, until he distilled and articulated it, that was unconscious
knowledge.  However, now that I know the "trick," I try very much to
have very good days even though I have high expectations.

I'm very lucky: I get the runner's high as I run, which leads itself
to a profound sense of gratitude (but not quite in a drunken
slobbering "I love you man" repeated ad nauseum sense).

This section contains entries for groups (and eventually individuals)
that I'm thankful for.  It's just shy of paralyzingly intimidating to
start writing these entries, because it's going to take a long time
and I certainly don't want any group or person to feel left out.
