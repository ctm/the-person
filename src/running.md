# Running

I run a lot. I'm also the race director for the [Baldy
50k](https://newmexicofa50k.wordpress.com/baldy_50k/) and the [Chimney
Melon
50k](https://newmexicofa50k.wordpress.com/chimney-melon-50k/),
which are two of the events in the [Albuquerque Fat Ass
Series](https://newmexicofa50k.wordpress.com/).

The Albuquerque Fat Ass Series is hosted (for free, thanks!) on
wordpress.com and as such it can't host the GPX files that
participants might want, so I host them here.

On Thursday, August 12th, [I'll be
giving](http://www.abqroadrunners.com/uploads/6/7/7/6/6776981/arr_newsletter_2021.august.pdf),
to the [Albuquerque Road Runners](https://www.abqroadrunners.com/), a
brief presentation on my Hardrock 2021 experience.
