# AGDG

I'm new to the [Albuquerque Game Developers Guild](https://agdg.co/)
but I've known one of the co-founders for years and he's one of the
friendliest people I know. Not surprisingly, the group he co-founded
is also welcoming.

When covid hit, a lot of the Albuquerque meetups slowly died. AGDG has
an active discord server and weekly remote meetings.  I don't consider
myself a game developer, per-se, but poker is a game and I am a
developer, so it's not like I'm just attending the meetings for the
free (virtual/remote) booze.
