# BARGE

The [BARGE website](https://www.barge.org/) explains what BARGE is
better than I can.

I attended my first BARGE in 1994.

It was through BARGE that I learned about handheld GPS devices (thanks
Patti and Bingo!), which got me into hiking.

When I needed to have a medical procedure done in San Francisco, two
BARGErs (thanks Patti and Charles) put me up.

I ran my first mile (on July 22nd, 2009) in anticipation of the BARGE
Fun Run. I even wrote email to a running friend of mine and told her
that I had just run my first mile and I actually enjoyed it but that I
hadn't caught the running bug (hah!).

BARGE members tested multibot, my first poker server and are actively
using mb2, the poker server I wrote twenty years later.

I owe these people a lot!
