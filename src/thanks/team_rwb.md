# Team RWB

Team RWB is a veteran's service organization that provides
opportunities for veterans and the community to connect through
physical and social activity. I first became aware of them when I saw
people in Team RWB shirts helping a man navigate the [Bataan Memorial
Death March](https://bataanmarch.com/) (BMDM) using a hand-cranked
vehicle to propel himself. His legs didn't function, but his arms did
and although I didn't know who they were at the time, it was clear he
had a most excellent support crew.

When I got back to the hotel room, I web searched Team RWB and learned
that they were open to civilians.  Eventually I decided to join because
my father served in the Air Force for twenty years and as an Air Force
brat I went to a few years of school on base. I figured I had a bit of
experience with the BMDM and perhaps I could help out some way.

Over the years our Albuquerque group has turned into a national
chapter through the great leadership of many captains. I'm lucky to
have found them and honored that they allow me to participate in their
various activities.
