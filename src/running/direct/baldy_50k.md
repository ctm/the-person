# Mt. Baldy 50k

This page compliments the official [Mt. Baldy 50k](https://newmexicofa50k.wordpress.com/baldy_50k/) page by
providing the GPX files (that I can't serve from wordpress.com) from
previous runnings of the Baldy 50k.

I've run Baldy 50k several times, but so far, I've only uploaded three
of them to Strava.

As far as I can tell from reviewing my paths on Strava, none of those
three have any significant wrong turns.  The ones from 2019 and 2020
have ridiculous elevation profiles though. They were made with an
ancient Ambit 3 that just does a horrible job with elevation.

file, click on the words "GPX File".
