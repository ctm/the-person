# Other GPX Files

Wordpress free hosting is an excellent service, but they don't allow
GPX files to be downloaded directly.  There are other excellent free
sites, like [trailrunproject.com](https://www.trailrunproject.com/)
that host GPX files, but require you to create a (free) account and
log-in to download them.

Most people are OK with using free accounts and the tracking that comes
with them to get useful information, but some aren't.  As such, not
only do I provide GPX files for the races I direct, I will also add
GPX files for other events so that people who wish not to be tracked
can download them.
