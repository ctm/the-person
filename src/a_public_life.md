# A Public Life?

I don't know for sure that I want to put a bunch of information about
myself on the net, although perhaps the most embarrassing or private
parts could be gleaned by anyone doing some web searching anyway.

If I go through with this, it will be sort of blog-like, in that I'll
add information that I think belongs here.  However, unlike a blog,
I'll try to keep the info current here, although it's quite possible
I'll delete the entire thing eventually.
