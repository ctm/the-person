<p>Congratulations for stumbling upon this. I haven't publicly announced
the link to this document, because it's a placeholder.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#a-public-life" id="a-public-life">A Public Life</a></h1>
<p>Greetings. I'm <a href="https://www.builtinnm.org/people/20">Cliff Matthews</a>
(<a href="https://members.teamrwb.org/profile/9056">Team RWB</a>, ), aka Clifford
Matthews
(<a href="https://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Clifford&amp;lname=Matthews">UltraSignup</a>),
aka deadhead (<a href="https://www.barge.org/">BARGE</a>,
<a href="https://devctm.com/">devctm</a>, <a href="https://www.marathonmaniacsdb.com/Maniacs/MyRaces?ManiacId=4395">Marathon
Maniacs</a>),
aka ctm (<a href="https://github.com/ctm">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://agdg.co/">Albuquerque Game
Developers Guild</a>). Although I don't wear a tinfoil
hat, I <em>am</em> concerned with privacy, albeit I'm more concerned with yours
than mine.</p>
<p>I don't participate in traditional social media. I do have a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/clifford-matthews-4a44231/">LinkedIn
account</a>,
although I haven't done a good job of keeping it up to date.  Hell, I
don't even have long hair and a beard in my picture.  I'm not trying
to mislead people; I'm just terminally lazy. I don't have a Facebook
or Instagram account.</p>
<p>Anyway, I've tossed various random stuff into <a href="https://github.com/ctm?tab=repositories">public
repositories</a> in my GitHub
account over the years. In 2016 I chose to publicly document <a href="https://github.com/ctm/Bataan-Memorial-Death-March/blob/master/2017.md">the
training</a>
I was planning on doing for the 2017 Bataan Memorial Death March. It
felt weird having so much info out there, but I did hear from others
who read it and appreciated that I made it available, so I've
continued that tradition and slowly added more info that people may or
may not find handy.</p>
<p>Before too long I'll be looking for investors in the company that I've
formed to monetize my poker software.  I figure investors are
potentially going to do some web sleuthing to find out more about me,
so putting a chunk of info here makes sense and it goes hand-in-hand
with doing post-running brain dumps that are kind of like a blog, but
done in mdbook (the format that this document is in).</p>
<p>Currently, on a typical week I run for a couple hours or more on
Mondays through Saturdays and ride my bike for a several hours on
Sunday.  This gives me a lot of time to think and record voice notes.
I'm planning to dump some of my thoughts into this &quot;book&quot;.  It's kind
of like me writing up thoughts for a younger version of myself and
probably equally pointless.  I don't (yet!) have a time machine and
younger deadhead listened to nobody.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#thanks" id="thanks">Thanks</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Wylie_Hubbard">Ray Wylie Hubbard</a>
closes his song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIQVG0Bcu6w">Mother
Blues</a> with the words</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;And the days that I keep my gratitude higher than my expectations, I
have really good days.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For me, until he distilled and articulated it, that was unconscious
knowledge.  However, now that I know the &quot;trick,&quot; I try very much to
have very good days even though I have high expectations.</p>
<p>I'm very lucky: I get the runner's high as I run, which leads itself
to a profound sense of gratitude (but not quite in a drunken
slobbering &quot;I love you man&quot; repeated ad nauseum sense).</p>
<p>This section contains entries for groups (and eventually individuals)
that I'm thankful for.  It's just shy of paralyzingly intimidating to
start writing these entries, because it's going to take a long time
and I certainly don't want any group or person to feel left out.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#agdg" id="agdg">AGDG</a></h1>
<p>I'm new to the <a href="https://agdg.co/">Albuquerque Game Developers Guild</a>
but I've known one of the co-founders for years and he's one of the
friendliest people I know. Not surprisingly, the group he co-founded
is also welcoming.</p>
<p>When covid hit, a lot of the Albuquerque meetups slowly died. AGDG has
an active discord server and weekly remote meetings.  I don't consider
myself a game developer, per-se, but poker is a game and I am a
developer, so it's not like I'm just attending the meetings for the
free (virtual/remote) booze.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#agdgat" id="agdgat">AGDGAT</a></h1>
<p>After the ADGD remote meeting finishes, a subset of members join for an
accountability meeting.  The premise is simple, each member briefly describes
the work that member did in the previous week, specifically compared to
the prediction that member made at the last meeting.  Congratulations,
sympathy, understanding and words of encouragement are provided and then
that member makes a prediction for the following week.  The predictions
are tracked on a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>I'm enjoying this process, even though I've fallen short more times
than I've exceeded my goals. I miss many meetings because <a href="thanks/agdg/../team_rwb.html">Team
RWB</a> meets for Taco Tuesdays twice a month,
but that's one nice thing about weekly meetings, there's another one
next week.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#barge" id="barge">BARGE</a></h1>
<p>The <a href="https://www.barge.org/">BARGE website</a> explains what BARGE is
better than I can.</p>
<p>I attended my first BARGE in 1994.</p>
<p>It was through BARGE that I learned about handheld GPS devices (thanks
Patti and Bingo!), which got me into hiking.</p>
<p>When I needed to have a medical procedure done in San Francisco, two
BARGErs (thanks Patti and Charles) put me up.</p>
<p>I ran my first mile (on July 22nd, 2009) in anticipation of the BARGE
Fun Run. I even wrote email to a running friend of mine and told her
that I had just run my first mile and I actually enjoyed it but that I
hadn't caught the running bug (hah!).</p>
<p>BARGE members tested multibot, my first poker server and are actively
using mb2, the poker server I wrote twenty years later.</p>
<p>I owe these people a lot!</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#team-rwb" id="team-rwb">Team RWB</a></h1>
<p>Team RWB is a veteran's service organization that provides
opportunities for veterans and the community to connect through
physical and social activity. I first became aware of them when I saw
people in Team RWB shirts helping a man navigate the <a href="https://bataanmarch.com/">Bataan Memorial
Death March</a> (BMDM) using a hand-cranked
vehicle to propel himself. His legs didn't function, but his arms did
and although I didn't know who they were at the time, it was clear he
had a most excellent support crew.</p>
<p>When I got back to the hotel room, I web searched Team RWB and learned
that they were open to civilians.  Eventually I decided to join because
my father served in the Air Force for twenty years and as an Air Force
brat I went to a few years of school on base. I figured I had a bit of
experience with the BMDM and perhaps I could help out some way.</p>
<p>Over the years our Albuquerque group has turned into a national
chapter through the great leadership of many captains. I'm lucky to
have found them and honored that they allow me to participate in their
various activities.</p>
